# Costco-Membership-analysis
### Prior to the anniversary of Costco membership, the question whether to renew is something all Costco members will need to determine. 
## Questions to answer:
1. Is it worth it to have Costco Executive membership vs regular membership.
2. Based on the cash back, compare Costco membership with other cash back credit cards.
3. Determine the scenerio with the highest cash back.

## Cleaning log:
1. Input the annual Costco expenditure into Excel spreadsheet
2. Calculate the total cost of Gas expenditure and Warehouse expenditure.
3. Calculate the total cash back for Gas and Warehouse based on Costco Executive membership terms: 4% Gas purchase, 2% Warehouse purchases
4. Calculate the total cash back for Gas and Warehouse purchases using Costco general membership terms and paring with other available cash back credit cards
to get cash back for gas purchases.

## Determine the best type of credit card cash back:
### Which card is best for shopping at Costco
1. Costco Exe Membership + citi card: 2% Warehouse purchase, 4% Gas purchase
2. Regular Costco Membership + General card: 2% BOA/2% Wells Fargo, 5% Gas quarterly card

## Analysis Result:
### Cash Back:
1. Exe + Citi card -> one year of cash back: $128.87
2. Reg + General card -> best case scenerio: 5% Gas cash back $100.43 2% Warehouse cash back $48.52 total: $148.95 *
3. Reg + General card -> worst case scenerio: 2% Gas cash back $40.17 2% Warehouse cash back $48.52 total: $88.69
<br/>* The 5% gas cash back credit card is only available for 3 months each year, therefore the best case is only legit if a 5% annual card for Gas becomes available

## Conclusion:
After deducting the general membership cost and the exe membership cost for all three scenerios, it turns out that the Exe membership is still the best
route to go giving back higher cash back, despite the $120 membership fees.
An alternative route is if a 5% gas cash back card becomes available year-round, then the 5% gas cash back card paired with general Costco membership will be the best route.
